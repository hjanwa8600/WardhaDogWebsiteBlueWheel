                  Food is a basic right for humans and non-humans alike. The
                  urban ecosystem in which street dogs supposedly thrive is a
                  myth. Scavenging for food in garbage and drinking water from
                  drains should not be normalized because it subjects these
                  animals to disease and prolonged ailments that go untreated
                  leading to a life of suffering on the streets and slow,
                  painful death after which they are either left to rot or
                  discarded in landfills. We have a duty to ensure their welfare
                  and protection. Feeding stray dogs has been declared an
                  essential service by the Animal Welfare Board of India as it
                  has a direct bearing on sterilization drives. Feeders or
                  colony caretakers make it easier for street dogs to get
                  vaccinated and sterilized without undergoing any stress.
                  Wardha Dog Rescue shall set up a food bank with the aid of the
                  local community, religious institutions, pet companies,
                  restaurants, and other relevant resources to feed 10,000 dogs
                  in Wardha District through a network of feeders and colony
                  caretakers. We also aim to provide aid to pet owners who donâ€™t
                  have the wherewithal to look after them thereby leading to
                  abandonment which further fuels stray dog population. We
                  currently feed street dogs in Sawangi within a 2 km range of
                  our shelter in Gajanan Nagri.
